# Pacmen
A small program with a button that generates the user determined amount of Pacmen. At any point the user can then hit the start game button and the Pacmen will start to move around the bounds of the screen and bounce off the walls, changing direction base on the left and right boundries.

## How to run: 
Drag HTML page into brower window, click on Add PacMan button to add as many PacMen as desired, then click the Start Game button. Enjoy!

## Updates
Most recently Updated code so that the PacMen would reverse directions when the hit the left and right walls and would chomp as they do in the game.

## Road Map:
Correct Pacmen generating over the Start Game button
Include virtical or diagonal facing Pacman for true directional represnetation
Combining with the Balls game to generate nodes for Pacmen to "eat"
