# pacmen
Provided code for PacMan Exercise from MIT Coding course Exersice was as follows:
Factory for making pacmen
You are given a starter.html code.
When button "make one" is pressed you need to complete the code 
to position the new pacman image and add it to the "game" div. It is then added to the array of pacmen, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each pacman.
You also need to make each pacman bounce off any wall it hits. 
Start by getting at least one pacman positioned and viewable.

How to run: 

Most recently Updated code so that the PacMen would reverse directions when the hit the left and right walls and would chomp as they do in the game.

Future possibilites would include virtical or diagonal facing Pacman pictures for a better representation of the game.
